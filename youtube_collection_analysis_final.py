🔍 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: CUMULATIVE METRICS CALCULATION

The analysis reveals that the "negative filtering percentages" and inconsistent 
video collection patterns are caused by how interval metrics are calculated:

1. CUMULATIVE VIDEO COUNTING:
   • The interval_metrics system counts ALL videos in storage, not just newly collected ones
   • Each metric record shows total videos accumulated over time
   • "videos_found_in_search" shows new videos from the current scraping run
   • But "video_count" is the cumulative total in the database
   
2. THE MATH PROBLEM:
   • videos_found_in_search = 20 (from current scraping run)
   • video_count = 540 (total videos accumulated over many runs)
   • Filter percentage = (20 - 540) / 20 * 100 = -2600%
   • This creates impossible negative percentages

3. WHY KEYWORDS GET FEWER THAN 20 VIDEOS:
   
   A. TIME FILTER EFFECTIVENESS:
      • YouTube search URLs use sp=CAISBAgBEAE%253D (last hour + sort by upload date)
      • Many keywords simply don't have 20 NEW videos uploaded in the last hour
      • This is actually WORKING CORRECTLY - there just aren't enough recent videos

   B. TITLE FILTERING IMPACT:
      • YOUTUBE_STRICT_TITLE_FILTER=true requires exact keyword match in video title
      • Analysis shows significant filtering:
        - 25-50% of videos have non-English titles
        - 18-28% contain "shorts" in title
        - Many legitimate videos get filtered out
      
   C. SEARCH RESULT LIMITATIONS:
      • YouTube's search API may return fewer than 20 results for niche keywords
      • Some keywords have limited content volume
      
   D. DUPLICATE FILTERING:
      • Redis-based deduplication prevents re-collecting same videos
      • This works correctly but reduces apparent collection rates

4. THE "20 VIDEO LIMIT" MISCONCEPTION:
   • The system is designed to collect UP TO 20 videos per run
   • If YouTube search only returns 5 relevant videos, that's all we get
   • This is correct behavior, not a bug

5. KEYWORD PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:

6. THE ACTUAL STATE OF THE SYSTEM:

   ✅ WHAT'S WORKING CORRECTLY:
   • Time filtering (last hour) - limiting to recent content
   • Duplicate prevention via Redis
   • Video storage in Firebase
   • Collection logging and metrics

   ⚠️ WHAT NEEDS ATTENTION:
   • Title filtering may be too aggressive for some keywords
   • Interval metrics calculation method is confusing (shows cumulative counts)
   • Some keywords may need different time filters (e.g., "last 6 hours")

7. WHY THE TIME FILTER IS MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EXPECTED:

   The "last hour" filter is actually working very well - perhaps too well:
   • Many AI/tech keywords don't have 20+ new videos every hour
   • This explains why keywords like 'claude' and 'midjourney' get <20 videos
   • The system is correctly finding only the recent content available

8. RECOMMENDATIONS:

   📈 OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES:
   
   A. Adjust Time Filters by Keyword Volume:
      • High-volume keywords (ChatGPT, AI): Keep "last hour"  
      • Medium-volume keywords: Use "last 6 hours"
      • Low-volume keywords: Use "last day" or "last week"
   
   B. Review Title Filtering:
      • Consider making YOUTUBE_STRICT_TITLE_FILTER=false for some keywords
      • Implement fuzzy matching for multi-word keywords
      • Allow partial matches for compound terms
   
   C. Fix Metrics Display:
      • Clarify that video_count is cumulative, not per-run
      • Show "new_videos_collected" as the primary metric
      • Calculate filtering percentages correctly
   
   D. Keyword-Specific Configuration:
      • Store optimal time filters per keyword
      • Track which keywords consistently hit limits
      • Adjust collection strategy based on historical performance

9. CONCLUSION:

   The system is NOT broken - it's working exactly as designed. The "problem" 
   of getting fewer than 20 videos is actually evidence that:
   
   • Time filtering is effective (good!)
   • YouTube doesn't always have 20 new videos for every keyword every hour (normal!)
   • The collection strategy should be adapted to keyword characteristics (improvement opportunity!)

   The negative filtering percentages were a red herring - they're just a display
   issue from cumulative counting, not a collection problem.
