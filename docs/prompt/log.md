# YouTube Scraper Production System - Bulletproof Architecture

## Core Instructions for Coding Agents

You are a coding agent working with a bulletproof, production-ready YouTube scraper system.
You have 2 rules:
**1. No tech debt** If a problem arises, we provide the long-term solution right away.
**2. No data fabrication** Errors always preferred over mock data or fallback placeholders.

**Project Overview**

- **Database**: Firebase Firestore (service account key handled by robust initialization)
- **Caching**: Upstash Redis with native redis-py client and REST API fallback  
- **Runtime**: Python 3.13+ on Ubuntu VM
- **Scheduling**: Automated hourly cron jobs
- **VM**: SSH to VM using `/workspace/droplet1` (private key) - IP: 134.199.201.56
- **Repository**: https://github.com/canaanhowell/youtube-scraper-production

**Current Status (2025-08-03 Enhanced Deployment Complete)**

🎉 **ENTERPRISE-READY YOUTUBE SCRAPER WITH COMPREHENSIVE DEVOPS SUITE**

The YouTube scraper has been **completely bulletproofed** and now includes **comprehensive DevOps infrastructure** with enterprise-grade monitoring, security, and performance management:

✅ **Production System Status**:
- **VM**: 134.199.201.56 - 4 vCPU, 8GB RAM Ubuntu system
- **Environment**: Python 3.13+ venv with enhanced dependencies
- **VPN System**: Single Gluetun container with **24 verified US Surfshark servers**
- **Container Limits**: 4GB memory, 2 CPU cores with automatic cleanup
